display_name: Astra DB
category: vector_stores
version: 1.0.0
overview:
  summary: Use Astra DB for AI and data tasks
  description: ':::warning It is recommended that you create any databases, keyspaces, and collections you need before configuring
    the **Astra DB** component. You can create new databases and collections through this component, but this is only possible
    in the Langflow visual editor (not at runtime), and you must wait while the database or collection initializes before
    proceeding with flow configuration. Additionally, not all database and collection configuration options are available
    through the **Astra DB** component, such as hybrid search options, PCU groups, vectorize integration management, and multi-region
    deployments. :::'
features:
- High-performance vector storage and retrieval
- Semantic search capabilities
- Scalable architecture
- Integration with embedding models
inputs:
  token:
    display_name: token
    type: Astra DB Application Token
    description: Input parameter. An Astra application token with permission to access your vector database. Once the connection
      is verified, additional fields are populated with your existing databases and collections. If you want to create a database
      through this component, the application token must have Organization Administrator permissions.
  environment:
    display_name: environment
    type: Environment
    description: Input parameter. The environment for the Astra DB API endpoint. Typically always `prod`.
  database_name:
    display_name: database_name
    type: Database
    description: Input parameter. The name of the database that you want this component to connect to. Or, you can select
      **New Database** to create a new database, and then wait for the database to initialize before setting the remaining
      parameters.
  endpoint:
    display_name: endpoint
    type: Astra DB API Endpoint
    description: Input parameter. For multi-region databases, select the API endpoint for your nearest datacenter. To get
      the list of regions for a multi-region database, see List database regions. This field is automatically populated when
      you select a database, and it defaults to the primary region's endpoint.
  keyspace:
    display_name: keyspace
    type: Keyspace
    description: 'Input parameter. The keyspace in your database that contains the collection specified in `collection_name`.
      Default: `default_keyspace`.'
  collection_name:
    display_name: collection_name
    type: Collection
    description: Input parameter. The name of the collection that you want to use with this flow. Or, select **New Collection**
      to create a new collection with limited configuration options. To ensure your collection is configured with the correct
      embedding provider and search capabilities, it is recommended to create the collection in the Astra Portal or with the
      Data API *before* configuring this component. For more information, see Manage collections in Astra DB Serverless.
  embedding_model:
    display_name: embedding_model
    type: Embedding Model
    description: Input parameter. Attach an embedding model component to generate embeddings. Only available if the specified
      collection doesn't have a vectorize integration. If a vectorize integration exists, the component automatically uses
      the collection's integrated model.
  ingest_data:
    display_name: ingest_data
    type: Ingest Data
    description: Input parameter. The documents to load into the specified collection. Accepts `Data` or `DataFrame` input.
  search_query:
    display_name: search_query
    type: Search Query
    description: Input parameter. The query string for vector search.
  cache_vector_store:
    display_name: cache_vector_store
    type: Cache Vector Store
    description: 'Input parameter. Whether to cache the vector store in Langflow memory for faster reads. Default: Enabled
      (`true`).'
outputs:
  vector_store:
    display_name: Vector Store
    type: VectorStore
    description: Configured vector store instance
